      Privacy Policy
      Public 311 is an Open311 client application designed for connecting you with the City of Public's Find It, Fix It service. Note that by using the Find It, Fix It service, you also are likely bound by their privacy policy (available at http://www.public.gov/pan/privacypol.htm). This policy is additive to that of the City of Public's privacy policy, since Public 311 is only a client application.

      Information Collected
      In the event of an application error, crash, or problem, we may ask you to send an email message with crash information. Such an email may contain personally identifiable information, and it is your choice whether to send such a message. While using the app, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and help you resolve support or assistance with the app. This will happen through a prompt asking for feedback, allowing you to send an e-mail message, and is not automatic. When you chose to interact with Find It, Fix It, we collect your unique device ID, unique Microsoft Account hash, name, phone number, and email address, if you choose to provide it. Whenever you submit a request to the Find It, Fix It service, you have the option of submitting anonomously and none of this information will be transmitted. Your unique device ID and Microsoft Account hash do not contain any personally identifable information and is never transmitted to any third party. In order to provide you with a better experience, to improve the application and its services, we may share non-identifying information (such as the current page within the application being viewed) to serve you better and analyze and understand how the app is used. There are application preferences that may enable or turn off such functionality.

      Age Policy
      Within accordance of Microsoft's Application Certification Requirements for Windows Phone, you must not create an account if you are not of the age of 13. As the Public 311 application does not require an account, this clause is handled by the Find It, Fix It terms of use, which designates that those younger than 13 may not use the service.

      Notes
      Find It, Fix It is a trademark of the City of Public. This application uses the Open311 application programming interface but is not endorsed or certified by the City of Public.
